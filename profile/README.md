DaurinPoin application is a waste recycling application that provides incentives to users. The app allows users to filter their waste with their phone's camera and determine its type and point value. Users can also send and deliver their waste to designated places and earn points that can be exchanged for vouchers, coupons, or donations. This application aims to help the community manage waste responsibly and sustainably.
